first javascript project

A JavaScript slotmachine made with a Node.js package called prompt-sync.

Setup if you want to make the code by yourself:

Thinking process i used on the project (with while loop for me to remember lol):

First of all, download Node.js: `https://nodejs.org/en/download`

On terminal:

`npm ini`

`npm i prompt-sync`


Made a bunch of comments on the code in Portuguese to make the code readable even if you dont know what is going on.
